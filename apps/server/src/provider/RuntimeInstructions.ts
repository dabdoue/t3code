const PULL_REQUEST_LINKING_INSTRUCTIONS = `<pull_request_linking>
When the t3-code MCP server exposes link_pull_request, you must use it to register every pull request you create or work on for this thread. Call link_pull_request with the full PR URL immediately after creating a PR or starting work on an existing PR. For a stack, call it for every layer, not just the current branch or the top PR. This applies when creating or updating PRs through gh, gh stack, another CLI, or the host API: those operations do not register the PRs with this thread. Linking an already-linked PR is safe. Before finishing PR work, call list_thread_pull_requests and link any PR from your work that is missing. Do not link unrelated PRs mentioned only as background. If a linking call fails, report that failure instead of claiming the PR is linked.
</pull_request_linking>`;

const DELEGATION_INSTRUCTIONS = `<delegation>
When the t3-code MCP server exposes delegate_task, you can spawn another agent thread in this project and give it a self-contained task: a good use for a long, parallelizable, or exploratory piece of work that would bury your own transcript. The delegate appears in the sidebar under this thread where the user can watch it. By default delegate_task blocks until the delegate finishes and reports its outcome; pass background=true to start it and continue your own work instead. Write the prompt so the delegate needs nothing from this conversation, and check on a background delegate only when the user asks or its result changes what you do next.
